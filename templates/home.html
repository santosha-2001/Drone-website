        The world receives more than 200 thousand people in a day and it is expected that the total
  world population will reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050. This will result in extra food
  demand, which can only be met from enhanced crop yield. Therefore, modernization of
  the agricultural sector becomes the need of the hour. There are many constraints that
  are responsible for the low production of crops, which can be overcome by using drone
  technology in the agriculture sector. This paper presents an analysis of drone technologies
  and their modifications with time in the agriculture sector in the last decade. The application of drones in the area of crop monitoring, and pesticide spraying for Precision Agriculture (PA) has been covered. The work done related to drone structure, multiple sensor
  development, innovation in spot area spraying has been presented. Moreover, the use of
  Artificial Intelligent (AI) and deep learning for the remote monitoring of crops has been
  discussed.
